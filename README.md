We'd like to see good examples of recommendations in practice as well as create a list of resources and guidelines to make it easier to create scientific software in an accessible way.

At this stage, some idea development is taking place on the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/accessibleresearchsoftware/accessibleresearchsoftware/issues)
and we are trying to use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/accessibleresearchsoftware/Lobby) for more informal discussion and planning.
